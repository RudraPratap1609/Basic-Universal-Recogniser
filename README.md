Basic Universal Recogniser

Introduction:-
This Python project can be used for basic face and object recognition. It uses the following libraries:
•	OpenCV (image, video processing)
•	PIL (image, video processing)
•	Ursina (UI and control)
•	Pickle (save-load files)
•	Numpy (numerical operations)

And for recognition, it uses the following models:
•	Yolo V3 Model for Objects
•	Self-Training Model using haar_cascades

Setup:-
Step-1: Enter this command on the terminal - “pip install opencv-contrib-python numpy pillow ursina”.

Step-2: Download the 4 required files (yolov3.weights, yolov3.cfg, coco.names, face.xml) from this github link - https://github.com/RudraPratap1609/Basic-Universal-Recogniser
Also copy the code from the link.

Step-3: Put the files in the same directory as the folder containing the code.

Step-4: Run the code. Use ‘Add Face’ button if using recognizer for first time.
